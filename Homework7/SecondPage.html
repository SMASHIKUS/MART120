The crystalline pupils of her mechanical eyes reflected a slowly approaching pale dot amid a sea of stars. If it were possible her smooth metallic skin would have been pebbled with goosebumps. When a Novarii scout ship jumped into this system one hundred ninety-seven rotations ago they couldn't possibly have known what theyâ€™d discovered. A planet showing any signs of life was incredibly rare but one with type three energy reading... this was the only one the flotilla had ever found throughout the millennia of its search. Could this planet finally hold some answers to Nova and, by extension, the Novarii people's origins? </p>
